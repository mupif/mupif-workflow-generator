This example has predefined structure for thermo-mechanical simulation.
The model classes are in implemented in file models.py.
File field_to_vtk.py includes basic model for easy export to VTK.

First, run main_class_code_generation.py and save the class code as class_code.py.
Then, run main_exec_code_generation.py and run the execution code.
