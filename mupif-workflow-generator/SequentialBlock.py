from ExecutionBlock import *


"""
 data structure for workflow editor

 The execution model is based on idea of combining ExecucutionBlocks
 Each block represents specific action or procedure and it is responsible
 for generating its code.
 The execution blocks can be composed/contain other blocks
 (an example is a time loop block, which contains blocks to be executed
  within a time loop)
 Each execution block can define its input and output slots, basically
 representing input and output parameters of particular block.
 The input/output slots can be connected using DataLink objects.
